##  Project Overview
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b5050a0-cdce-46e0-90a8-8f4cf50ca321)
This project presents a smart autonomous robot that acts as a **restaurant waiter**, combining AI-based gesture/voice interaction, real-time obstacle detection using **YOLOv8**, and precise control powered by **PID tuning** and **ESP32** integration.

- **Sensors**: Load Cell, MPU6050  
- **Power**: 6x Lithium-Ion Batteries  
- **Software**: ROS Noetic, Python, OpenCV, YOLOv8, MediaPipe

PID Tuning:
- `Kp = 1.2`, `Ki = 0.5`, `Kd = 0.01`

---

##  Robot Kinematics & Control

- **Inverse Kinematics**: Maps velocity commands to wheel RPMs  
- **Forward Kinematics**: Estimates position using encoder data  
- **PID Controller**: Ensures smooth and accurate movement

##  Go-To-Goal Navigation
*Insert Image Here (e.g., trajectory plot)*

A Euclidean distance-based algorithm lets the robot move to a designated goal table autonomously while tracking heading and distance errors in real-time.

##  AI Systems

###  Sign Language Detection
*Insert Image Here (e.g., dataset samples or gestures)*

- **MediaPipe Hands** for landmark extraction  
- **Random Forest Classifier** for real-time gesture recognition (A, B, L)  
- Used for **contactless table selection**

###  YOLOv8 Obstacle Detection
*Insert Image Here (e.g., object detection frame)*

- Custom-trained on 2,500+ images  
- Detects wet floors & fallen knives  
- Dynamic steering based on obstacle position in frame  
- Proximity safety threshold: **40 cm**

---

##  Teleoperation
*Insert Image Here (e.g., teleop_keyboard usage)*

### Keyboard Control
- `W` = Forward  
- `S` = Backward  
- `A/D` = Rotate  
- `U` = Speed Up

### Voice Control (ROS Node)
*Insert Image Here (e.g., microphone/voice diagram)*

- Uses Google Speech Recognition API  
- Understands: forward, stop, turn left/right, speed up

---

##  Operational Workflow
*Insert Image Here (e.g., robot with tray in kitchen)*

1. Gesture Command Issued  
2. Tray Loaded Manually  
3. Navigates While Avoiding Obstacles  
4. Verifies Pickup via Load Cell  
5. Returns to Kitchen Automatically

---

##  Gesture-Based Scanning & Analytics
*Insert Image Here (e.g., customer scanning scene)*

- Gesture 'L' triggers 180¬∞ scanning  
- YOLO-based camera scan for customer presence  
- Gathers analytics and confirms service delivery

---

##  Mechanical Design
*Insert Image Here (e.g., chassis photos)*

- Built using **3mm MDF**  
- Includes custom-designed tray, shaft, and camera mount  
- Sturdy and easy to maintain

---

##  Electronics Hardware
*Insert Image Here (e.g., component diagram or wiring)*
