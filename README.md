- **MediaPipe Hands** for landmark extraction  
- **Random Forest Classifier** for real-time gesture recognition (A, B, L)  
- Used for **contactless table selection**

###  YOLOv8 Obstacle Detection
*Insert Image Here (e.g., object detection frame)*

- Custom-trained on 2,500+ images  
- Detects wet floors & fallen knives  
- Dynamic steering based on obstacle position in frame  
- Proximity safety threshold: **40 cm**

---

##  Teleoperation
### Keyboard Control
- `W` = Forward  
- `S` = Backward  
- `A/D` = Rotate  
- `U` = Speed Up

### Voice Control (ROS Node)

- Uses Google Speech Recognition API  
- Understands: forward, stop, turn left/right, speed up
